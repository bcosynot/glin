# **Glin**
*Your worklog, without the work.*

---

### âœ¨ What is Glin?
**Glin** is an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) that **automatically builds your worklog** from two places you already live in:

- The **prompts and conversations** you have with your **agentic coding assistant**
- Your **git history**

No more manual logging. No more "what did I even do today?" moments.  
Glin captures your flow of work as it happens â€” transparently, in the background â€” and turns it into a clean, searchable record.

### ðŸ”® Why Glin?
Developers spend hours *doing*, but often forget the **telling**:
- Daily standups
- Sprint updates
- Performance reviews
- Knowledge transfer

Glin flips the script: your tools already know what you did â€” it just makes that knowledge **visible**.

Think of it as a **black box recorder for your dev work**: light, ambient, and surprisingly insightful.
