Title: Phase 8 â€” Deployment & Ops (GitHub Pages via Actions)

Summary
Automate docs deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions and configure repository Pages settings. Optionally add PR previews.

Why
- Ensures every push to main builds and publishes docs; reduces manual steps.

Tasks
1) Add GitHub Actions workflow for docs at .github/workflows/docs.yml:
   - On: push to main (and optionally pull_request for previews)
   - Steps: checkout; setup Python 3.13; install via uv; `uv run mkdocs build --strict`
   - Deploy: publish `site/` to gh-pages using peaceiris/actions-gh-pages; preserve CNAME if present
2) Configure GitHub Pages in repo settings (manual):
   - Source: gh-pages branch
   - Custom domain (optional): ensure CNAME exists
3) Optional PR previews:
   - Upload built `site/` as artifact or use a preview action so PRs show a preview link

Files/Artifacts
- .github/workflows/docs.yml
- gh-pages branch (generated by the workflow)
- CNAME file (optional, if using a custom domain)

Commands
- Commit the workflow file and push to main
- Verify gh-pages updates after the first run

Verification (Done when all true)
- On pushes to main, the workflow builds and publishes to gh-pages without errors
- Site is accessible over HTTPS; redirects work as expected
- (If configured) PRs show preview links

Junior implementation notes
- Keep the workflow minimal and cache-aware (uv caches by default); ensure strict build so broken links fail CI.
