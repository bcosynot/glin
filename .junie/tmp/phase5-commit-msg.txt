docs: Phase 5 — UX, accessibility, and quality gates

Implements Phase 5 of the MkDocs plan:

- Search UX: verified built-in Material search is enabled (mkdocs.yml: plugins.search) and fast
- Tabs: ensured multi-client/OS tabs in Quick Start and MCP Clients; tabbed extension enabled
- Admonitions: added warning/tip blocks for risky steps (e.g., env precedence in Workspace guide)
- Prev/Next: confirmed logical nav order to enable Material prev/next links
- Accessibility: reviewed headings, added/verified alt text on badges and descriptive link text; kept semantic h2/h3 usage
- Performance: kept landing/lightweight assets; local Lighthouse ready to run
- Quality gates (CI): added `.github/workflows/docs-quality.yml` to enforce `uv run mkdocs build --strict` and run external link checks (lychee)

Verification on 2025-10-26 15:21 local:
- `uv run mkdocs build --strict` passes locally
