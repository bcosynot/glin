# Glin Project Roadmap

*Your worklog, without the work.*

---

## üéØ Vision
Build an MCP server that automatically generates developer worklogs by capturing git history and AI assistant interactions, making daily standups, sprint updates, and performance reviews effortless.

---

## üìç Current Status (v0.1.0)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Basic MCP server setup with FastMCP
- [x] Git commit retrieval tools:
  - [x] `get_recent_commits` - Fetch N recent commits
  - [x] `get_commits_by_date` - Fetch commits by date range
- [x] HTTP transport support for CLI usage
- [x] Development tooling (ruff linter)
- [x] Project documentation (README)

### üöß Current Limitations
- No AI conversation capture
- No worklog generation/summarization
- No persistent storage
- No filtering or search capabilities
- No multi-repository support
- Basic git integration only (commits, no diffs or file changes)

## üé™ Release Strategy

### Alpha (v0.1.0 - v0.4.0)
- Internal testing
- Core feature development
- Breaking changes allowed

### Beta (v0.5.0 - v0.7.0)
- Limited public release
- Feature complete for basic use cases
- API stabilization

### Stable (v1.0.0+)
- Public release
- Semantic versioning
- Backward compatibility guarantees

---

## üìä Success Metrics

### Adoption
- Number of active users
- Daily active usage sessions
- Repository integrations

### Quality
- Bug report rate
- User satisfaction scores
- Response time performance

### Impact
- Time saved on status updates (self-reported)
- Accuracy of generated worklogs
- Feature usage distribution

---

## ü§ù Contributing Priorities

### High Priority
- Git history analysis improvements
- Conversation capture mechanisms
- Summarization quality

### Medium Priority

## üìù Notes

- **Privacy-first**: All features must respect user privacy
- **Local-first**: Core functionality should work offline
- **Incremental value**: Each phase should deliver standalone value
- **Modular design**: Features should be pluggable/optional
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for common queries
