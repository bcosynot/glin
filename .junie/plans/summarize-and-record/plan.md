### Plan: Summarize and record conversation message

Last updated: 2025-10-20 01:39 (local)

Objective
- Produce a concise, useful summary of the recent work (Google Calendar OAuth loopback integration plan) and record it into Glin’s conversations log using the MCP `record_conversation_message` tool.
- Keep the summary self-contained, include links/paths to artifacts, and make it easy to reference later.

Scope
- Summarize: What was done, where it was stored, key decisions, and next steps.
- Record: Create a new conversation entry titled appropriately and store the summary as a single message.
- Optional: Append a brief note to WORKLOG.md for the current date pointing to the conversation and plan file.

Constraints and conventions
- Do not include secrets.
- Use concise bullets; prefer actionable phrasing.
- Follow repository conventions for conversations and markdown appends (see `glin/markdown_tools.py`).

Steps
1) Draft the executive summary (authoring)
- Capture:
  - Context7 sources consulted and chosen libraries (IDs).
  - Chosen auth flow (Installed App with loopback redirect) and rationale.
  - Output artifact location: `.junie/plans/gcal-integration/plan.md`.
  - MVP definition: list calendars + list events; read-only.
  - Next steps and testing approach (mock Google APIs; no network).
- Format as 8–12 bullets; keep it under ~200 words.

2) Record the message (MCP)
- Use `mcp_glin_record_conversation_message` with:
  - role: `assistant`
  - title: `GCal OAuth plan — summary (2025-10-20)`
  - conversation_id: `None` (create new)
  - content: the executive summary from Step 1
- Store returned `conversation_id` and `message_id` in the task notes or logs if applicable.

3) Optional: Append a pointer in WORKLOG.md
- Use `markdown_tools.append_to_markdown` to add a short bullet under today’s heading:
  - "Recorded GCal OAuth plan summary; see conversation <id> and `.junie/plans/gcal-integration/plan.md`."
- This step is optional and may be skipped if the worklog is not required.

4) Verification
- Ensure the conversation entry is created and retrievable (tool returns IDs without error).
- Manually spot-check message content and title for accuracy and redaction (no secrets).

5) Acceptance criteria
- A new conversation exists with a clear title and contains the concise summary message.
- Summary references the correct file path `.junie/plans/gcal-integration/plan.md`.
- No secrets or tokens are present.
- (Optional) WORKLOG.md has a dated bullet referencing the conversation.

6) Rollback/cleanup
- If the conversation was created in error, note the `conversation_id` for potential deletion or create a corrective follow-up message.
- If a worklog pointer was added incorrectly, append another bullet noting the correction.

7) Timeline
- Draft summary: ~5 minutes
- Record message: immediate (<1 minute)
- Optional worklog append: ~1 minute

Appendix: Draft executive summary template
- Pulled up-to-date Context7 docs: `/googleapis/google-auth-library-python`, `/googleapis/google-api-python-client`.
- Chosen auth: OAuth 2.0 Installed App with loopback (localhost) for best desktop UX (auto browser + local callback).
- Auth + API plan authored and saved at `.junie/plans/gcal-integration/plan.md`.
- MVP scope: read-only; list calendars and list events within a time range; TypedDict models and retries.
- Token storage: SQLite `oauth_tokens` (refresh token focus), with CRUD helpers; no secrets in logs.
- Config: env > glin.toml for client id/secret, auth method, scopes; defaults to `calendar.readonly`.
- Testing: no network; monkeypatch Google client + OAuth flow; deterministic results.
- Next: device flow for headless, create/update/delete events, optional worklog export.
- Security: minimal scopes, never log tokens, provide revoke.
