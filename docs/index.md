## Why Seev

Seev turns your real work—commits, PRs, and AI conversations—into a clean daily worklog. No copy‑pasting. No end‑of‑day scramble.

- Manual status updates steal time and are easy to forget.
- Signals get buried across repos, PRs, and chats.
- Reviews and performance cycles demand accurate histories.

How Seev helps and what you get:
- Automatic capture from git and your AI assistant
- Privacy‑first and local‑first by default
- MCP‑native: works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, and more
- Fast first success: up and running in minutes
